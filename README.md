# Object_detection

Identifying an object in Computer vision consists in surrounding the Object detected with a bounding box.
There are different object detection methods commonly used in computer vision implemented: 
detecting objects by their color, by their movement, or with deep learning.

For this project, I used Tiny-Yolo with the aim of creating a light and fast software and COCO Dataset to recognize objects from a dataset of 80 things.
but in this project restrictedd to 5 things
